        Note: 0MQ Sockets are *not* threadsafe. **DO NOT** share them across threads.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        context : Context
            The 0MQ Context this Socket belongs to.
        socket_type : int
            The socket type, which can be any of the 0MQ socket types: 
            REQ, REP, PUB, SUB, PAIR, DEALER, ROUTER, PULL, PUSH, XPUB, XSUB.
