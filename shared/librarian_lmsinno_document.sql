The authors focus on the importance of natural language-the carrier of knowledge and intelligence-for artificial intelligence (AI) study. This book develops a framework that shows how uncertainty in AI expands and generalizes traditional AI. It describes the cloud model, its uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness, and the correlation between them. The book also centers on other physical methods for data mining, such as the data field and knowledge discovery state space. In addition, it presents an inverted pendulum example to discuss reasoning and control with uncertain knowledge as well as provides a cognitive physics model to visualize human thinking with hierarchy.

Whether we regard them as conscious or unwitting, revere them as a new form of life or dismiss them as mere clever appliances, is beside the point.

The emergence of systems capable of independent reasoning and action raises serious questions about just whose interests they are permitted to serve, and what limits our society should place on their creation and use.

Human-robot interaction raises serious ethical questions right now that are theoretically less ambitious, but practically more important than the possibility of the creation of moral machines that would be more than machines with an ethical code. The ethical perspective addressed in this volume is therefore the one we humans have when interacting with robots. Topics include the ethical challenges of healthcare and warfare applications of robotics, as well as fundamental questions concerning the moral dimension of human-robot-interaction including epistomological, ontological and psychoanalytic issues. It deals also with the intercultural dialogue between Western and Non-Western as well as between European and US-American ethicists."--P.

The behavior of biological systems provides both the inspiration and the challenge for robotics. The goal is to build robots which can emulate the ability of living organisms to integrate perceptual inputs smoothly with motor responses, even in the presence of novel stimuli and changes in the environment. The ability of living systems to learn and to adapt provides the standard against which robotic systems are judged. In order to emulate these abilities, a number of investigators have attempted to create robot controllers which are modelled on known processes in the brain and musculo-skeletal system. Several of these models are described in this book. On the other hand, connectionist (artificial neural network) formulations are attractive for the computation of inverse kinematics and dynamics of robots, because they can be trained for this purpose without explicit programming. Some of the computational advantages and problems of this approach are also presented.

This volume is the first book to bring together prominent scholars and experts from both science and the humanities to explore these and other questions in this emerging field.Starting with an overview of the issues and relevant ethical theories, the topics flow naturally from the possibility of programming robot ethics to the ethical use of military robots in war to legal and policy questions, including liability and privacy concerns. The contributors then turn to human-robot emotional relationships, examining the ethical implications of robots as sexual partners, caregivers, and servants.

A cyber-enigma with an enthusiastic following, it pops up in headlines and fuels endless media debate. You can apparently use it to buy almost anything from coffee to cars, yet few people seem to truly understand what it is. This raises the question: Why should anyone care about Bitcoin? In THE AGE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY, Wall Street journalists Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey deliver the definitive answer to this question. Cybermoney is poised to launch a revolution, one that could entirely re-invent traditional financial and social structures while bringing the world''s billions of "unbanked" individuals into a new global economy. Cryptocurrency represents the promise of a financial system without a middleman, one owned by the people who use it and one safeguarded from the devastation of a 2008-type crash. But bitcoin, the most famous of the cybermonies, brings with it a reputation for instability, wild fluctuation, and illicit business; some fear it has the power to eliminate jobs and to upend the concept of a nation-state. It implies, above all, monumental and wide-reaching change—for better and for worse. But it is here to stay, and you ignore it at your peril. Vigna and Casey demystify the concept of cryptocurrency, detailing its origins, its function, and what you need to know to navigate a cyber-economy.

It is a system of payment that eliminates the requirement of a financial intermediary between two parties wanting to transmit money using the internet. It is a less costly method and at times, it’s totally free. The transaction is kept unnamed as well. A man named Satoshi Nakamoto invented a new type of digital currency that could use the method of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) System, in 2008. This network itself is commonly referred as individual’s network that is decentralized and these individuals don’t need to know each other essentially. This system would allow the network that is decentralized, to work mutually cracking Algorithms by using high-powered rearranged Graphics Cards probably cracking a block that yielded the reward of cryptocurrency. Here Satoshi wanted to be the first one to crack and collect the profits of the famous "Genesis Block" in 2009.

The teacher goes from the prime of his career to retirement, competes in whitewater kayaking at the international level, and loses a son. The student matures from high school math whiz to Ivy League professor, suffers the sudden death of a parent, and blunders into a marriage destined to fail. Yet through it all they take refuge in the haven of calculus--until a day comes when calculus is no longer enough. Like calculus itself, The Calculus of Friendship is an exploration of change. It''s about the transformation that takes place in a student''s heart, as he and his teacher reverse roles, as they age, as they are buffeted by life itself. Written by a renowned teacher and communicator of mathematics, The Calculus of Friendship is warm, intimate, and deeply moving. The most inspiring ideas of calculus, differential equations, and chaos theory are explained through metaphors, images, and anecdotes in a way that all readers will find beautiful, and even poignant.

The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner-product spaces are introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator.', 'Springer', 2018, 0, 1600, 0, 0, 'https://books.google.com/books/content?id=5qYxBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2', '2018-02-03', 0);

The techniques are illustrated by a wide sample of applications and examples that are chosen to highlight the tools of the trade. In short, this is material that many of us wish we had been taught as graduate students. Roughly the first third of the book covers the basic material of a first course in linear algebra. The remaining chapters are devoted to applications drawn from vector calculus, numerical analysis, control theory, complex analysis, convexity and functional analysis. In particular, fixed point theorems, extremal problems, matrix equations, zero location and eigenvalue location problems, and matrices with nonnegative entries are discussed. Appendices on useful facts from analysis and supplementary information from complex function theory are also provided for the convenience of the reader. In this new edition, most of the chapters in the first edition have been revised, some extensively. The revisions include changes in a number of proofs, either to simplify the argument, to make the logic clearer or, on occasion, to sharpen the result.

In my view, the content is unique in that it blends traditional teaching approaches with the use of mathematics and a mainstream Hardware Design Language (HDL) as formalisms to describe key concepts. The book keeps the “machine” separate from the “application” by strictly following a bottom-up approach: it starts with transistors and logic gates and only introduces assembly language programs once their execution by a processor is clearly de ned. Using a HDL, Verilog in this case, rather than static circuit diagrams is a big deviation from traditional books on computer architecture. Static circuit diagrams cannot be explored in a hands-on way like the corresponding Verilog model can. In order to understand why I consider this shift so important, one must consider how computer architecture, a subject that has been studied for more than 50 years, has evolved. In the pioneering days computers were constructed by hand. An entire computer could (just about) be described by drawing a circuit diagram.

The book covers various aspects that relate to performance evaluation, ranging from performance metrics, to workload selection, to various modeling approaches such as analytical modeling and simulation. And because simulation is by far the most prevalent modeling technique in computer architecture evaluation, the book spends more than half its content on simulation, covering an overview of the various simulation techniques in the computer designer''s toolbox, followed by various simulation acceleration techniques such as sampled simulation, statistical simulation, and parallel and hardware-accelerated simulation. The evaluation methods described in this book have a primary focus on performance. Although performance remains to be a key design target, it no longer is the sole design target. Power consumption and reliability have quickly become primary design concerns, and today they probably are as important as performance. Other important design constraints relate to cost, thermal issues, yield, etc. This book focuses on performance evaluation methods only. This does not compromise on the importance and general applicability of the techniques described in this book because power and reliability models are typically integrated into existing performance models. These integrated models pose similar challenges to the ones handled in this book. The book also focuses on presenting fundamental concepts and ideas. The book does not provide much quantitative data.

Keith Reinhard of DDB Needham actually articulates this linkage between the old and new in his invited chapter. What the reader will encounter in Advertising and the World Wide Web is a solid conception of how Web advertising is different from anything that has come before. There are numerous discussions on consumer and advertiser interactivity, the role of Web advertising within larger campaigns, audience segmentation, and alternative Web-based promotion formats. The five sections cover definition and theory, structure, specific applications, legal issues, and the voice of the practitioner. Although there remain a few nay-sayers concerning the future of Web advertising, the reader will be able to see just how incredibly high-impact this new medium has become and the vast potential that it holds for future promotional endeavors.', 'Psychology Press', 2018, 0, 1100, 0, 0, 'https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gi15AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2', '2018-02-03', 0);

This can be one of the most frustrating areas for programmers new to JDBC, and Donald covers it well with detailed information and examples showing how to make database connections from applications, applets, Servlets, and even from Java programs running within the database itself. Next comes thorough coverage of JDBC''s relational SQL features. You''ll learn how to issue SQL statements and get results back from the database, how to read and write data from large, streaming data types such as BLOBs, CLOBs, and BFILEs, and you''ll learn how to interface with Oracle''s other built-in programming language, PL/SQL. If you''re taking advantage of the Oracle''s relatively new ability to create object tables and column objects based on user-defined datatypes, you''ll be pleased with Don''s thorough treatment of this subject. Don shows you how to use JPublisher and JDBC to work seamlessly with Oracle database objects from within Java programs. You''ll also learn how to access nested tables and arrays using JDBC.
